Chapter 1. Temporal EDA, Variables & Date Manipulation

Learn how to do effective exploratory data analysis on temporal data,
create scalar and table variables to store data, and learn how to execute date manipulation.
This chapter will also cover the following SQL functions: DATEDIFF( ), DATENAME( ), DATEPART( ),
CAST( ), CONVERT( ), GETDATE( ), and DATEADD( ).

------------------------------ EXERCISES -----------------------------------------

-- 1. Transactions per day
SELECT
  -- Select the date portion of StartDate
  CONVERT(DATE, StartDate) as StartDate,
  -- Measure how many records exist for each StartDate
  COUNT(*) as CountOfRows 
FROM CapitalBikeShare 
-- Group by the date portion of StartDate
GROUP BY CONVERT(DATE, StartDate)
-- Sort the results by the date portion of StartDate
ORDER BY CONVERT(DATE, StartDate);


-- 2. Seconds or no seconds?
SELECT
	-- Count the number of IDs
	COUNT(ID) AS Count,
    -- Use DATEPART() to evaluate the SECOND part of StartDate
    "StartDate" = CASE WHEN DATEPART(SECOND,StartDate) = 0 THEN 'SECONDS = 0'
					   WHEN DATEPART(SECOND, StartDate) > 0 THEN 'SECONDS > 0' END
FROM CapitalBikeShare
GROUP BY
    -- Use DATEPART() to Group By the CASE statement
	CASE WHEN DATEPART(SECOND, StartDate) = 0 THEN 'SECONDS = 0'
		 WHEN DATEPART(SECOND, StartDate) > 0 THEN 'SECONDS > 0' END


-- 3. Which day of week is busiest?
SELECT
    -- Select the day of week value for StartDate
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, StartDate) as DayOfWeek,
    -- Calculate TotalTripHours
	SUM(DATEDIFF(SECOND, StartDate, EndDate))/ 3600 as TotalTripHours 
FROM CapitalBikeShare 
-- Group by the day of week
GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY, StartDate)
-- Order TotalTripHours in descending order
ORDER BY TotalTripHours DESC


-- 4. Find the outliers
SELECT
	-- Calculate TotalRideHours using SUM() and DATEDIFF()
  	SUM(DATEDIFF(SECOND, StartDate, EndDate))/ 3600 AS TotalRideHours,
    -- Select the DATE portion of StartDate
  	CONVERT(DATE, StartDate) AS DateOnly,
    -- Select the WEEKDAY
  	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, CONVERT(DATE, StartDate)) AS DayOfWeek 
FROM CapitalBikeShare
-- Only include Saturday
WHERE DATENAME(WEEKDAY, StartDate) = 'Saturday' 
GROUP BY CONVERT(DATE, StartDate);
